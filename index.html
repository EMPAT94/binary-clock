      <h2>What witchcraft is this?</h2>
      <p>
        To answer the question, this is a CLOCK (as the heading so pointedly suggests, we'll get to BCD later). It is
        meant to tell the current time (from your system clock, in your timezone; if you care about that stuff).
        Fret not, once you understand the working of it all, this will seem little more than childs play to you!
      </p>


      <h2>Well, how does it work then?</h2>
      <p>
        Quite simple really, it tells time in military format (ie the 24-hour format). The first 2 columns (from your
        left) indicate hours, next 2 indicate minutes and final 2 show the seconds. Check it out, the last column will
        be updated on an every-second interval.
      </p>

      <h2>But there are no numbers, how to tell the time?</h2>
      <p>
        Using a little math, I'd say; each digit of the time HH:MM:SS is encoded into its equivalent binary format
        (hence the name BCD, which stands for 'Binary Coded Decimal'). For example let's say the current time is 2:30
        pm which in 24-hour format is 14:30 hours, thus the binary equivalent of each digit is '0001' '0100' : '0011'
        '0000' (imagine the same for seconds)
      </p>
      <p>
        This binary format is represented by the positional indicators in each column. Extending our previous example,
        to represent 2 pm or 14 hours or the binary '0001' '0100', our clock's hour section (first 2 columns from left,
        in case you forget) will glow accordingly. For '0001', first 3 indicators (from top) will be off, last one will
        be
        ON. For '0100', only 2nd indicator will be ON.
      </p>

      <h2>I still don't understand how to tell time!</h2>
      <p>
        Well, since you've come so far, it'll let you in on the secret. Imagine a number in each block/indicator -
        First row indicators will have number 8, next row 4, next 2 and finally 1. Something like this :
        <pre>
        | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
        | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
        | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
        </pre>

        Now, let us assume some of the indicators are ON, like those marked by X below :
        <pre>
        | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
        | 4 | X | 4 | 4 | X | 4 |
        | 2 | 2 | X | 2 | 2 | X |
        | X | 1 | X | 1 | 1 | 1 |
        </pre>

        Simply calculate the sum of ON indicators for each column, like this :
        <pre>
        | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
        | 4 | X | 4 | 4 | X | 4 |
        | 2 | 2 | X | 2 | 2 | X |
        | X | 1 | X | 1 | 1 | 1 |
          1   4   3   0   4   2 
        </pre>

        Well, there you have it, the time is 14:30:42 ie 2:30 pm (and 42 seconds!)
      </p>


      <h2>Interesting! Where can I learn more?</h2>
      <p>
        I have learned about and created this BCD Clock out of pure curiosity; took me a few hours to read & code it
        out. My point - this is not meant to be a one stop shop for all things BCDC. In fact, most representations of a
        BCD Clock skip the unneeded indicators (like indicators of 4 & 8 for hours). There are also different types of
        binary clocks; who knows, you may come up with an innovative representation all on your own!
